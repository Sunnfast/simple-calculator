## Overview
This is a virtual calculator that functions using JavaScript. The challenge was that the calculator must use number buttons (i.e. no typing to input the numbers) and needed to be coded without using the Calc() or Eval() functions. This project has helped me improve:  DOM manipulation skills, handling multiple variables, and using Event Listeners.

The basic design for this calculator was originally inspired by the calculator I used in primary school, TI-30XIIS. Due to the nature of how real physical calculators and number pads, I elected to use CSS Grid for all of the buttons. 

However, I found that the colors were a bit too dull for my tastes and based my palatte off of the color teal instead. The 'branding' of the design was based on Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings universe.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- add, subtract, divide, and multiply pairs of numbers
- receive an error message if they attempt to divide by zero
- use negative numbers and decimals (in progress!)

In the future, I would like to develop...



### Useful resources

- [The Odin Project Assignment Prompt](#), provided a general overview of what I should prioritize first in my development and common bugs to be wary of.
